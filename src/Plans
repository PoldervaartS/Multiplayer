Plans as of now
	utilize writing as bytes to overhaul the entire information sending system
	make an NPC
	
Bug report
	partial fix by changing client to only send new information
		Bad line possibly coming from a bullet despawning while the loops is going through all the bullets for the player
		making sentArray volatile does not work
		using a constant int for bullet size does not work
		Only messes up on the 10th bullet/9th bullet
	Figure out why players made first then AI in players arraylist
